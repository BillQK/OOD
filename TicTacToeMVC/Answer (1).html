                    <p>1)Lululemon has taught about the importance of staying on core
products while arranging marketing strategy. Lululemon constantly
stayed on athleisure clothing strategy which includes yoga clothing
and gym clothing. The company has used yoga experts and gym experts
for its promotional ventures while conducting social media
marketing and other promotional activities. It has pointed out the
fact that it is important to arrange promotional strategy with the
people who have knowledge and understanding about the use of the
products as it becomes more convincing to the target audience.
Moreover, the outlet marketing strategy has helped the company to
expand the number of outlets which is currently 491. Mirror company
has focused on an important marketing lesson which is of providing
products that are different from the product offerings of
competitors. Myriad allows full-length Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enable
fitness mirror that can be doubled as a reduced screen to access a
large number of recorded and live virtual fitness routines.
Customer engagement has become a pivotal part of the marketing
strategy of Mirror.<br />
2) Lululemon and mirror should expand their marketing platforms by
using most digital media platforms like YouTube, Pinterest, and
Instagram. Moreover, both companies should be careful about
diversifying their offerings to attract more customers.</p>
